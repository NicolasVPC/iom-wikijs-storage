# Set up a symfony project in Docker
src: https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/docker.html
According to the guidelines of symfony documentation there are two supported ways to run symfony projects through docker:
- The Complete Docker Environment; it's an environment where PHP, web server, database, etc. are all in docker. https://github.com/dunglas/symfony-docker 
- The symfony binary docker integration; Ã¨ necessario aver installato PHP nella propria macchina locale.
---

Installing the [Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download) and running `symfony check:requirements` we encountered the following problems:

**no PHP binaries detected**
if the output is `no PHP binaries detected`, it means that you don't have php installed on the system, running `sudo apt install php-common libapache2-mod-php php-cli` will fix this issue.

****

``` bash                   
 [ERROR]                                          
 Your system is not ready to run Symfony projects 
                                                  

Fix the following mandatory requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * simplexml_import_dom() must be available
   > Install and enable the SimpleXML extension.
